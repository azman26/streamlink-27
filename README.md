# Streamlink[-27]
Streamlink is a CLI utility which pipes video streams from various services into a video player, such as VLC.

The main purpose of streamlink is to avoid resource-heavy and unoptimized websites, while still allowing the user to enjoy various streamed content.

Streamlink[-27] is a fork of the <a href="https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink">Streamlink</a> project.

The project extension [-27] indicates that this project continues to support python 2.7, as the streamlink project has discontinued python 2.7 support as of version 1.7.0.
